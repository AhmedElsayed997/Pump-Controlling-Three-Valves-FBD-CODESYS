# Pump-Controlling-Three-Valves-FBD-CODESYS

## Introduction
This project involves designing a control system for a water pump that operates in two modes: Manual and
Automatic. It ensures proper water distribution to two villages using level and pressure sensors. The
implementation was done using the CODESYS software and the Functional Block Diagram (FBD)
programming language.

## System Components
- Water Pump
- 3 Valves
- Pressure Sensor
- Hydrostatic Level Sensor
- PLC Controller
- Piping Network
- Emergency & Overload Protection
- LED Indicator
  
## Operation Modes
Automatic Mode:
- All three output valves must be open.
- Pressure must be greater than 6 bars.
- Water level must be above 2 meters.
